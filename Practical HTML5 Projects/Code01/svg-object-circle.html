        <h1>Which browser should you design for?</h1>
        <article>
            <strong>The answer is all of them.</strong> If you survey a group of computer
            aficionados you will get very different answers compared with the general
            publicâ€™s answers.&nbsp;
            I worked as a freelance computer technician for over eleven years, During that
            period
            I never came across a single person who was using a browser other than Internet Explorer.
            <aside>
                The great majority of ordinary folk are using IE because it came pre-installed with their
                computers.
            </aside>
            None had ever heard of Mozilla Firefox, although I did meet one person whose son had put Firefox on
            his
            computer,
            he wanted me to remove it because he did not know what it was.
            The great majority of ordinary folk are using IE because it came pre-installed
            with their computers. When reading magazine surveys, it would be safer to increase the survey
            figures for
            Internet Explorer.
            The result would mean that you should make sure that your websites work in IE7 and IE8 because these
            are the most popular by default. It would be safe to predict that there will be a strong swing
            towards IE 9 when it is finalised in 2011.

            <summary><b>A COMPUTER FOR &pound;15?</b></summary>
            <p>The UK not for profit organization Raspberry Pi is hoping to sell<br> a computer for &pound;15
                (or less if the take up is good).<br>
                It is no bigger than a USB connector, it has an ARM chipset, <br>a wi-fi chip, a version of the
                BASIC progrmming language <br>and it is preloaded with the Linux operating system. The primary
                purpose <br>for this innovation is as a teaching tool for UK schools where children <br>are
                bored stiff with the current curriculum. You can read more about it at
                <br>http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive//2011-01/20/raspberry-pi-computer
