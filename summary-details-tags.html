<summary><b>A COMPUTER FOR &pound;15?</b></summary>
<p>The UK not for profit organization Raspberry Pi is hoping to sell<br> a computer for &pound;15 (or less if the take up is good).<br>
It is no bigger than a USB connector, it has an ARM chipset, <br>a wi-fi chip, a version of the BASIC progrmming language <br>and it is preloaded with the Linux operating system. The primary purpose <br>for this innovation is as a teaching tool for UK schools where children <br>are bored stiff with the current curriculum. You can read more about it at <br>http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive//2011-01/20/raspberry-pi-computer</p>
